              We had tons of fun. We made candles at wix. After we just rode scooters  
              around downtown provo and checked out a bunch of stores and restaurantes. 
              She loved it!

              It had been my first date in a while... I was so nervous! I played hard to get 
              at first because I didn't wanna be one of those typical Provo girls. But he treated 
              me so well though! We to a Brazillian festival that happens every year. The people 
              there were so nice to us!

              We had known each other for a while now, but it took me a while to muster some courage 
              to take her out. We went paiting at the Y parking lot. It was late afternoon and the view/sunset 
              was so awesome! And it turns out she was SO good at painting. She made me look like a 
              kindergartener. But she loved it!

              It is going to sound cliche but he took me to Squaw peak and we made out for hours on end.
              Oh my gosh he is an icredible kisser!
